# Purpose

This repository contains a very basic Rails 5 app.

The code contains many problems: please **identify** these problems and propose **fixes**.

# Startup

It is not essential to run the app in order to find the issues, but it may help you to do so and that's totally fine. The standard Rails startup procedure should be enough:

````
$ bundle
$ bin/rails db:create db:seed
$ bin/rails s
````
